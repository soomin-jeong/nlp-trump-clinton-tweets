## Project Description
This project is designed to implement data analysis mainly focusing on natural language processing (NLP) on the dataset of tweets by Hilary Clinton and Donal Trump during the US president election in 2016. Since the political communication on social networks is getting more prevalent, this project expects to generate more interest in how politicians utilize this unconventional media for their interest. 

This project was developed to practice natural language processing to practice the materials from course 'Intelligent Systems' instructed by Mariano Rico(mariano.rico@upm.es) at Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid.

## Dataset
The dataset was collected by Ben Hamner at Kaggle team. It provides approximately 3000 tweets from Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump during US president election in 2016.
